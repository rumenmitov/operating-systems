* Problem 1.1
** a)
I ran `strace -c /bin/date` and that gave me a total of 133 syscalls.
I ran `ltrace -c /bin/date` and that gave me a total of 47 library calls.

**b)
Top 3 Syscalls:
1) mmap        - establishes a mapping between the address space of a process 
                 to the memory object represented by the file descriptor
2) openat      - opens a file for reading and/or writing; if the path is relative
                 it is associated with the file descriptor instead of with the current 
                 directory
3) newfstatat  - access file information

Top 3 Library Calls:
1) fwrite      - writes data to stream
2) fputc       - writes a character to a stream
3) __freading  - returns a nonzero value if the stream is read-only,
                 or if the last operation on the stream was a read operation, 
                 and zero otherwise.


* Problem 1.2
** a)
open() fails when search permissions are denied.
close() failes when the file descriptor is not an opened file descriptor.

** b)
When no errors occured, errno is set to 0.
